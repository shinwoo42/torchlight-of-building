I want to make a single page application, which will serve as a charcter build planner for the game, Torchlight Infinite.
In essence, this website will allow a user to select different things like their gear, skills, talents, etc and see different calculations, including their estimated DPS, defences, stats, etc.
This is heavily inspired off of Path of Building, a community made tool for Path of Exile.

I want to implement the TalentPage, which is a bit like a passive tree. The data for all the talent trees is contained within the data/ directory, with each file representing a different tree.

* The first talent tree must be one of the god or goddess trees, and none of the remaining 3 may be god or goddess trees
* Each column requires at least (column * 3) points allocated total in the columns before it
  * For example, the first column requires 0 points allocated, while the 4th column will require 9 points allocated in the tree
* If a node has a pre-requisite, then the pre-requisite node must have all points allocated up to its max points
For now, implement a RawTalentPage interface, which stores 


Actual TODOs:

Input crafting options from tlidb (how to handle and where to put affix ranges). Probably just a list per equipment type or whatever?
